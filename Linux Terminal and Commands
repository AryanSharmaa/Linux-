 Linux has a CLI (command line interface). In this tutorial, we are going to cover the basic commands that we use in the shell of Linux.
 To open the terminal, press Ctrl+Alt+T in Ubuntu, or press Alt+F2, type in gnome-terminal, and press enter.
 
 Basic Commands:
 1. pwd
    You can use the pwd command to print the working directory..


2. ls
   To list the contents of a directory, you use the ls command (short for list). 
   When you run the ls command without any arguments, it lists the contents of the present working directory by default.
   The output of the ls command is formatted differently based on the file type.


3. cd
   You can change to a different directory using the cd command (short for change directory).
