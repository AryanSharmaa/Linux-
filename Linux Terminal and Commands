 Linux has a CLI (command line interface). In this tutorial, we are going to cover the basic commands that we use in the shell of Linux.
 To open the terminal, press Ctrl+Alt+T in Ubuntu, or press Alt+F2, type in gnome-terminal, and press enter.
 
 Basic Commands:
 1. pwd
    You can use the pwd command to print the working directory..


2. ls
   To list the contents of a directory, you use the ls command (short for list). 
   When you run the ls command without any arguments, it lists the contents of the present working directory by default.
   The output of the ls command is formatted differently based on the file type.


3. cd
   You can change to a different directory using the cd command (short for change directory).


Default arguments
i) What if you execute the cd command without any destination? Can you try it and see where it takes you? (Hint: Use pwd to check where you were taken to)

ii) Can you try the ls command with a directory name?

iii) Experiment with the cd and ls commands with different arguments.


NOTE:
If you don’t provide any argument to the cd command, it defaults to the user’s home directory. The ls command defaults to the present working directory.

There is a symbol to denote a user’s home directory. The tilde (~) sign.

cd ~ will take you to your home directory.

ls ~ will list the contents of your home directory.
